  <p>Who needs a website anyway? We've got Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+&mdash;thousands upon thousands of social networking platforms, blogging networks, and publishing services. Anything you need to say can be said there, owned by others and indexed for the convenience of advertisers. If none of that works, you can always e-mail me.</p>
